name: session-end
description: Use when branch work is finished and the user asks to close the session out — "/session-end", "encerra a sessão", "fecha essa branch", "vamos encerrar aqui", "abre o PR e faz o merge", "leva até o merge e limpa a branch", "finaliza e limpa o worktree". Not for work still in progress, and not when the user only asked to push.

# Session End

Finished branch in → merged `main`, production in sync, pendings recorded, branch and worktree gone. One continuous pass, no "should I continue?" between steps.

**Announce at start:** "Using session-end to take `<branch>` from pushed to merged and cleaned up."

## Authorization

The invocation authorizes, **for the work already on this branch only**: committing what is left, applying its migrations, deploying its edge functions, writing the pendings file, pushing, opening the PR, merging into the default branch, and deleting the branch + worktree afterwards. This is the one place where the standing "never open a PR / never merge without an explicit ask" rule is satisfied — the invocation *is* the ask.

**Not authorized:** new features, refactors, fixing unrelated findings, force-pushing, squashing, rewriting history, deleting anything outside the branch and its worktree.

Human gates — only these:
1. **Step 0** — confirm the branch and the pendings list when either is ambiguous.
2. **Escalations** — a red gate, an unapplied migration, a merge conflict, an unverified deploy.
3. Nothing else.

## Project rules win

Read the project's `CLAUDE.md` / `AGENTS.md` at Step 0 and obey it over any default here.

- **Never bypass a gate.** No `--no-verify`, no `--force`. A failing hook is an escalation, not an obstacle.
- **Merge strategy follows the project.** History-preserving projects merge with `--merge`; **never `--squash`** unless the project asks for it.
- **Deploy through the project's wrapper** (e.g. `scripts/sb-deploy.sh`), never a bare `supabase functions deploy` that skips the gate.
- **Migrations follow the project's discipline** — file-first via the migration CLI, preflight evidence where required.
- **Generated/hook-owned files** (e.g. `src/integrations/supabase/types.ts`) are not committed on a branch when the project forbids it. They get regenerated after the merge (Step 8).

## Step 0 — Pre-flight inventory

Everything downstream reads from this inventory. Build it once; never re-derive it from memory.

1. **Where am I.** `git rev-parse --show-toplevel`, `git branch --show-current`, `git worktree list`. If the current branch is `main`/`master` **and there is no worktree to close**, stop — there is nothing here.
   **But being on the default branch is the correct starting state for an orchestrator closing several branches**, so do not read that stop as an abort. `git worktree list` shows the branches waiting; enter each one (`EnterWorktree` with its path) and run this skill through, once per branch, returning with `ExitWorktree` between them. A session that ran a multi-fork build can close every branch itself — one orchestrator did exactly this for five, in sequence, with no refusal.
   **Inside a worktree, compound bash is refused**: no `cd X && …`, no redirects, no `for` loops, and no `-C` aimed at a different worktree. Every command becomes simple and one per call. Nothing announces this, and it changes how each step below is written.
2. **Base and diff.** `BASE=$(git merge-base HEAD origin/main)`; then `git diff --name-only $BASE...HEAD` and `git status --porcelain`. Record both.
3. **Derive from the diff:**
   - migration files (`supabase/migrations/**` or the project's equivalent),
   - edge/serverless function dirs (`supabase/functions/**`) — plus **every consumer** if a shared module changed, since shared code is bundled, not referenced,
   - generated files the project forbids committing.
4. **Uncommitted work.** Untracked or modified files in the diff scope get committed at Step 5. Files clearly outside the branch's purpose are **left alone** and named in the final report — never swept into the commit.
5. **Collision check.** If the project shares one database/runtime across sessions, run its gate (e.g. `npm run collide`) before applying anything.
6. **Create the ledger** (see below) and one todo per step.

## Step 1 — Verify before anything irreversible

**When a failure's justification may have aged out, prove the merge resolves it without merging.** `git merge-tree --write-tree origin/main <branch>` computes the merged tree and mutates nothing — exit 0 plus the corrected blob in the resulting tree is proof, and it costs no branch state. Observed: a branch's last failing test was justified as "this file is byte-identical to `origin/main`" — true when measured, and falsified when a neighbouring session merged the fix afterwards. `merge-tree` settled it in one command, and the merged default branch then ran clean.



Run the project's full lint, typecheck, build and test suite **yourself** and read the actual output. Red → fix it or stop and report. Never migrate, deploy or merge off a red branch.

## Step 2 — Migrations

**A migration applied before the merge hides from the main checkout.** The CLI's list prints local and remote columns, and the *files* still live on the branch — so everything this run applied shows up **only in the remote column, with the local one blank**. A grep anchored to the local column returns **zero of yours** while happily listing other sessions' work, which reads exactly like *nothing was applied* — and acting on that reading undoes production. One run had **nine** in that state (seven from one spec, two from another). Read the remote column, and cross-check against the branch's own migration files.

**Beware the count that is true of a spec and false of the run.** In that same case a fork reported seven, correct for its own spec and wrong as an answer to "how many did this run apply". A correct value answering a different question than the reader is asking was the single most recurrent failure of that day — when you quote a number, say what it counts.



For every migration file in the inventory, confirm it is actually applied to the target database — `supabase db push` (or the project's equivalent), then confirm against the remote ledger (`supabase migration list --linked`). "It was probably applied earlier in the session" is not confirmation.

A migration file on the branch that is **not** in the remote ledger is a hard stop on the merge.

## Step 3 — Edge functions

For every changed function in the inventory, deploy through the project's wrapper, preserving `verify_jwt`. **Verify by re-downloading and grepping for the change** (`supabase functions download <name>`) — a version bump proves nothing. Run the project's drift check afterwards if it has one.

Note in the ledger that this deploy will likely be **undone by the merge** (Step 8 redeploys).

## Step 4 — Pendings

Collect what the session leaves behind: deferred review findings, cut scope, TODOs added to the diff, verification only a human can do, anything parked with a ruling. Sources are the session ledger and the diff — not recollection.

**When the work was built by someone else — a fork, an earlier session — ask for density explicitly, or the default answer is useless.** Left unasked, a hand-off reports *"found X, deferred"*. Asked in these words, it reports entries that paste straight in. Use the phrasing that worked, close to verbatim:

> *"Send me the parked findings with enough density that I can transcribe them straight into the pendings file without reopening the investigation — file and line, the number you measured and how you measured it, the shape of the fix, and the exposure that stays open meanwhile."*

That request produced **13 items transcribed almost directly** in a five-branch close-out. And require one more field the phrasing above does not cover: **any proof that cannot be reproduced**. An equivalence established before a migration that now makes the old path raise is not re-runnable, and an entry that does not say so sends the next reader chasing a break that is not there.

**Nothing deferred → skip this step entirely.** Do not create an empty file, do not invent filler items.

Otherwise, find the pendings file (`PENDINGS.md` at the repo root, else `docs/PENDINGS.md`, else the project's named equivalent). **If none exists, create `PENDINGS.md` at the repo root by copying [pendings-template.md](pendings-template.md) verbatim** — header plus the `---`, nothing else. That header is load-bearing: never edit it, never drop it, never write items above it.

**The file's own header outranks this skill.** A pendings file created from an older template carries a different shape (prose items under thematic `##` categories, no status markers). Do not convert it and do not mix formats: read the header, write what it prescribes. The rules below are the current template's shape and apply to files that carry the current header. Language and voice always follow the file.

Under the current header, one `##` section per plan/slice, **newest first**, titled `## <Area> — <Plan or slice name> (<YYYY-MM-DD>)`, followed by the plan file path so the context is recoverable. Add your section at the top; never reopen an old one for new work.

**Entry shape** — a `-` bullet opening with a status tag, **3–6 lines**, carrying exactly three facts: what is pending · why it was not done · what unblocks it. Anything that is not one of the three is cut.

- Status is one of `OPEN` (needs doing) · `GATED` (blocked on a decision or an external condition — **name the gate**) · `ACCEPTED` (knowingly left as-is; not a bug, do not re-flag it). There is no fourth status. Something genuinely resolved is **deleted**, never re-tagged `DONE`/`FIXED`/`CLOSED` — the file is not a graveyard.
- Every identifier, number, path and error string stays exact. Terse means fewer words, never vaguer facts: `403 on getMarketplaceParticipations` survives, "an auth problem" does not.
- No credential-rotation chores. Secret hygiene is handled outside this file.
- An entry that touches another slice's domain is **recorded, not fixed unilaterally** — say whose it is and let the owner decide.
- More than six lines means it is really two entries, or it belongs in the plan/spec — link there instead of re-explaining.

```markdown
## Repo — CI static analysis (2026-08-20)

Plan: `docs/plans/2026-08-20-edge-static-analysis.md`

- `OPEN` — **`supabase/functions` (88 functions, ~20.700 lines) deploys with no typecheck and no
  lint**: no `deno.json`, no CI job, no hook covering the directory. _Why:_ `deno check` cannot be
  turned on today — 0 of 95 `createClient(` calls pass the `<Database>` generic, so every `.from()`
  collapses to `never`. _Unblocks:_ typed client factory in `_shared/` first (forces a redeploy of
  all 88), then the gate. Own branch.
```

An entry with no "why it was not done" is a task you should have done, not a pending. An entry with no unblock is a wish.

An item with no "por que não foi feito" is a task you should have done, not a pending. An item with no cost estimate is a wish.

## Step 5 — Commit and push

Commit the remaining branch work (conventional commit, project language, one per logical unit — not one per file). Then `git push -u origin <branch>`. Never force-push.

## Step 6 — Pull request

`gh pr create --base main`, title = the branch's purpose, body = the Step 10 report (so it persists in GitHub). Include the harness attribution footer if the project uses one.

## Step 7 — Merge

Hard-gated. Re-check before merging: lint/build/test green, every branch migration in the remote ledger, no unresolved load-bearing review finding, working tree clean, no conflicts with `main`. Any of those red → **stop and report; never merge anyway.**

Then `gh pr merge --merge` (project policy; **never `--squash`** on a history-preserving repo). **Do not pass `--delete-branch`** — the worktree still has the branch checked out and the delete will fail or strand the worktree.

**`gh pr merge` prints nothing on success**, so silence is not evidence either way. Confirm with **`git branch -r --contains <sha>`** rather than `gh pr view --json state`: in a live run the `gh` call was refused by a classifier twice while the git query answered every time. `MERGED` — however you establish it — is the only acceptable state before Step 8.

### Merging `main` into the branch trips a three-step trap, and the middle step looks correct

Hit in a real close-out, worth walking before you meet it:

1. The merge brings a **hook-owned generated file** (typically `types.ts`) into the index, which **drops the gate that normally keeps it off the branch** — the gate only fires on a staged change you made, and this one arrived by merge.
2. `.gitattributes` usually marks that file `merge=ours`, so the "correct" resolution is to keep the branch's version. **This is the step that looks right and is not.**
3. Because the code arriving from `main` calls RPCs the branch's older generated types do not know, keeping the branch version **breaks the build** — a genuine `TS2345`, not an artefact.

The way out is to **regenerate the file locally and never commit it**. Then remember at Step 9 that the tree is now deliberately dirty.

**And there is a fourth step, which is where it actually bites: that repair fixes the branch and breaks `main`.** Because step 1 made `main` an ancestor, merging the branch back carries its **whole tree** — including the stale generated file. `main`'s typecheck then fails on the very RPC the old file never knew. Measured end to end in a real close-out, and the gate's own message had predicted it in writing: *goes stale on the next migration and, via `merge=ours`, clobbers main's copy.* Reading the warning and understanding it as theory was not enough.

**The repair is blocked by two gates closing over the same file** — one refusing non-doc commits on `main`, the other refusing that file on a branch — so no commit is possible without the bypass this skill forbids. **When two gates close over one file, look for the project's own tool that is permitted to cross both, instead of breaching one.** It usually exists: here a dedicated script is by design the only place that regenerates and commits that file, only on `main`, using the bypass deliberately and documented. Note that such a tool may **self-skip** when its usual trigger is absent — this one looks for a migration in the change set, and the damage had come from a merge — so it had to be invoked by hand with a migration path fed to it. Using the sanctioned tool outside its usual trigger is still using it; breaching a gate is not.

## Step 8 — Post-merge sync

The merge changed `main`; production usually needs a second pass.

1. **Redeploy every changed function** through the project's wrapper and re-verify by download. On hosts that redeploy in bulk on a push to `main`, the merge silently reverted the Step 3 deploy. Re-run the drift check.

   **The trigger is *any* push to the default branch, not the merge — a docs-only commit does it.** Measured in one close-out: the deploy reverted **three times**, and the first was **before** the merge, caused by a commit that touched no function at all; ten functions dropped back. It then reverted again on the merge push, and again on the pendings push. So **deploy is the last action after the last push** — running docs → deploy → docs → deploy wastes a full round that docs → docs → deploy avoids.

   **How to tell a revert from your own bug:** download the deployed function and run `git status` on the downloaded file. **Clean** means the deployed bundle is byte-identical to the *old* source on the default branch — that is a revert, not a mistake you made. In that run the forbidden call count in one function went from 0 back to 2, and the clean status is what proved it.

   **And bound the blast radius before treating it as an incident:** hosts revert **code only** — migrations already applied stay applied. So the damage of such a revert is limited to what lives purely in the function. Confirm the two flanks anyway: that no scheduler still points at the reverted function, and that the callers you removed are really gone from the database side.
2. **Regenerate hook-owned generated files** (e.g. `npm run types`) on the main checkout if the schema changed, especially when the merge resolved them `ours`.
3. `git pull origin main` on the main checkout so it reflects the merge.

## Step 9 — Cleanup

Only after Step 7 confirmed `MERGED`.

1. **Leave the worktree first.** You cannot remove the directory you are standing in — `ExitWorktree`, or `cd` to the main checkout. Skipping this is the most common failure of this step.
2. Confirm nothing is stranded: `git log <branch> --not origin/main --oneline` returns empty, and `git -C <worktree> status --porcelain` is clean. Non-empty → **stop and report**; never delete unmerged commits or uncommitted files.
3. `git worktree remove <dir>` → `git branch -d <branch>` (lowercase `-d`, which refuses unmerged work) → `git push origin --delete <branch>`.
4. Confirm: `git worktree list` and `git branch -a` no longer show it.

**`git branch -d` measures against the branch's UPSTREAM, not against `HEAD`** — so on a collapsed topology it refuses a branch that is fully merged:

```
warning: not deleting branch '<A>' that is not yet merged to
         'refs/remotes/origin/<A>', even though it is merged to HEAD
error: the branch '<A>' is not fully merged
```

The remote had frozen behind while the local branch advanced, which never happens when each branch gets its own pull request — the merge moves or deletes the remote — and always happens to a branch that collapsed into a sibling's. **The expensive mistake is reading that refusal as "use `-D`"**, which discards silently if the containment claim was ever wrong. Correct order: prove containment with `git log <branch> --not origin/main` returning empty, **delete the remote ref first**, then `-d` succeeds on its own.

**`git worktree remove` refuses a dirty tree, and Step 7 may have made it dirty on purpose.** The regenerated generated file is left uncommitted deliberately, so this is exactly where the temptation to reach for `--force` appears — and `--force` here discards work without reading it. Instead, `git checkout` the *generated* file (only that one, and only because it is reproducible by a command) and then remove the worktree normally. If anything else is dirty, stop and report: that is the case this step exists to protect.

**A remote branch already deleted by the host is not a failure.** Many forges delete the head branch on merge, so `git push origin --delete` answers `remote ref does not exist`. That is the expected outcome of an already-completed cleanup — confirm with `git branch -r` and move on. **Run `git fetch --prune` before that confirmation**, or `git branch -a` keeps listing `remotes/origin/<branch>` for a while and the cleanup check appears to fail.

**Two shell traps that make a correct result look like a failed command**, both hit while verifying this step:
- **`grep -c` exits 1 when the count is 0.** A compound verification whose whole point is "zero orphan commits" therefore reports failure at the moment it succeeds.
- **Piping a command hands you the pipe's status, not the command's** — see the push confirmation above; the same applies to every check here.

If the session ran directly on the main checkout with no worktree, steps 1 and 3's `worktree remove` simply do not apply — switch to `main` and delete the branch.

## Step 10 — Report

Compose from the ledger, never from memory, in the user's language:

- **Mergeado** — PR number and URL, commit range, what shipped.
- **Aplicado em produção** — migrations applied (+ ledger confirmation), functions deployed (+ how each was verified after the merge).
- **Pendências registradas** — each item written to the pendings file, with its file path.
- **Pendências fechadas** — each item **removed** from the file because this session resolved it. Easy to omit, because the report is built from what you wrote and closing an item leaves nothing to point at — but on a cleanup-heavy branch it can be the larger half of the work. One close-out recorded 13 items opened and said nothing about **17 closed**, until the user asked outright *"didn't you remove the ones you fixed?"* — and had no way to know otherwise.
- **Re-read the pendings file after writing it**, and check whether anything that *survived* was invalidated by this session's own work. The same check that surfaced the omission above also found two stale survivors: one item claiming a property held for "exactly one of ~200 migrations" when the session had made it six, and another conditioned on a ratchet that closed that same day. Your own diff is the most likely thing to have falsified the list you are leaving behind.
- **Você precisa revisar** — what only a human can check: visual/UX, live e2e, external panel config.
- **Limpeza** — branch and worktree removed, or exactly why one survived.
- **Deixado de fora** — untracked/unrelated files left in the working tree, and anything cut.

## Ledger

`.superpowers/session-end/<YYYYMMDD-HHMM>/ledger.md`, first line `# session-end — branch: <name>`. Append after every step: inventory → verification output → migration state → deploy + verification method → pendings written → PR number → merge state → cleanup. Context does not survive compaction; the ledger does. On resume, trust the ledger, `git log` and `gh pr view` over recollection, and restart at the first step with no completion line.

## Common mistakes

| Mistake | Reality |
|---|---|
| "Tests passed earlier in the session" | Re-run the full suite at Step 1. Nothing else gates the merge. |
| "The migration went in when I wrote it" | Confirm against the remote ledger. An unapplied migration merged into `main` breaks production. |
| "Deploy returned a new version, so it shipped" | Re-download and grep. A version bump proves nothing. |
| "I deployed at Step 3, so production is current" | The merge push to `main` can revert branch deploys. Redeploy at Step 8. |
| "`gh pr merge --delete-branch` saves a step" | The worktree holds the branch. It fails, or strands the worktree. Delete after removing the worktree. |
| "`git worktree remove` from inside the worktree" | You cannot delete your own cwd. Exit first. |
| "`git branch -d` refuses, so I need `-D`" | `-d` compares against the **upstream**, not `HEAD`. Prove containment, delete the remote ref, then `-d` passes on its own. `-D` would discard silently if you were wrong. |
| "I deployed after the merge, so production is current" | Any later push to the default branch reverts it — a docs-only commit will do. Deploy last, after the last push. |
| "The migration list shows none of mine, so nothing was applied" | Pre-merge migrations appear only in the **remote** column, local blank. Acting on that reading undoes production. |
| "`git branch -D` is faster" | `-D` discards unmerged commits silently. Use `-d` and let it refuse. |
| "Nothing deferred, but the file should exist" | No pendings, no file. An empty pendings file is noise. |
| "Squash keeps history tidy" | History-preserving projects lose the per-phase commits. `--merge`. |
| "Report from memory" | Compose from the ledger. Compaction eats what you did not write down. |

## Red flags — stop

- About to merge with red lint/build/tests, or with a branch migration missing from the remote ledger.
- About to `--squash`, `--force`, `--no-verify`, or amend on a shared branch.
- About to `git branch -D` or `git worktree remove --force` with unmerged commits or a dirty tree.
- About to delete the branch before `gh pr view` reported `MERGED`.
- About to edit or drop the pendings file's header.
- About to sweep unrelated working-tree files into the branch commit.
- About to fix a newly-found bug instead of writing it to pendings — this skill closes work out, it does not open new work.
